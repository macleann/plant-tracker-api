         "note": "The White Bird of Paradise, also known as Strelitzia nicolai, is a stunning tropical plant native to South Africa. It thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and requires watering when the top inch of soil feels dry. Use a well-draining potting mix with perlite or sand to ensure proper drainage and prevent waterlogging, as this can lead to root rot. Fertilize your White Bird of Paradise every 4-6 weeks during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Keep the plant away from drafts and cold temperatures, as it prefers warm, humid environments. Propagate through division of mature clumps or by seeds, although seeds may take several years to produce flowers.",
